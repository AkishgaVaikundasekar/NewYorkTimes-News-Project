# 📰 NYT Top Stories App

This is a simple front-end project that fetches and displays the latest top stories from The New York Times using their Top Stories API.

## 📋 What the App Does

- Lets you choose a news section (like Home, World, Technology, Arts)
- Fetches the top 5 stories in that section from the New York Times
- Displays the title, summary, and a link to the full article

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Choose a section from the dropdown
3. Click "Get News"
4. When prompted, enter your New York Times API key
5. Enjoy the latest stories!

## 🔑 How to Get Your NYT API Key

1. Go to [https://developer.nytimes.com](https://developer.nytimes.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Click on “Apps” > “+ Add App”
4. Enable the **Top Stories API**
5. Copy your API key

When you open the app, it will ask you to paste your API key once. The key will be saved temporarily in your browser for that session.

## 🔐 Security Note

- The API key is **not stored in the source code**
- Instead, it’s saved in **sessionStorage**, which keeps it only while your tab is open
